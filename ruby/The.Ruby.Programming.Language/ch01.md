p12: Loosely speaking, `puts` prints a string of text to the console and appends a newline (unless the string already ends with one).


p13: When printing an array, for example, `p` outputs it using array literal notation, whereas `puts` simply prints each element of the array on a line by itself.


p13: `irb` does have a number of other important features, however, including subshells (type "irb" at the prompt to start a subshell) and configurability.


P21: # Note that the + operator on arrays does concatenation but that the - operator performs a set difference operation


P26: There is no way to embed a comment in the middle of a line of code.


P51: This kind of literal is borrowed from Unix shell syntax and is historically known as a `here document`. (Because the document is right here in the source code rather than in an external file.)


P52: In fact, after reading the content of a here document, the Ruby interpreter goes back to the line it was on and continues parsing it.


P52: If the here document begins with `<<`, then the delimiter must start at the beginning of the line. If the literal begins with `<<-` instead, then the delimiter may have whitespace in front of it. The new line at the beginning of a here document is not part of the literal, but the newline at the end of the document is, Therefore, every here document ends with a line terminator, except for an empty here document, which is the same as "":


delimiter中文翻译是：定界符、分隔符。


遇到一个问题：
```
print "hello\r"
```
输出什么都没有


P52: This is the same as using single identifier, except that it allows spaces within the delimiter.


注意理解比较的是`single identifier`，而不是`single quotes delimiter`.


P27: Documentation comments ... They are usually written as multiline comments where each line begins with `#`, but they can also be written as embedded documents that start `=begin rdoc`


P29: ... Unicode ... codepoint ...


P31: The best practice it to treat these keywords as reserved.


P33: ... Ruby 1.9 .. If the first nonspace character on a line is a period, then the line is considered a continuation line. ...


P33: Ruby's grammar allows the parentheses around method invocations to be ommitted in certain circumstances. This allows Ruby methods to be used as if they were *statements*. which is an important part of Ruby's elegance.


P34: ... Expressions can be combined with Ruby's keywords to create `statements`.
